# ArduinoTouchPhone
Hello, this is some very poorly written jank code to interface the touchpad from an old landline phone with an Arduino ProMicro.  
I attempt to avoid (I think) weird scanning issues by floating a bunch of pins while pulling others up.  
The code just polls the entire matrix continuously to obtain state (sorry).  
Enjoy :)
